  "faq_title": "Common Questions",
  "faq1_question": "How long does a project usually take?",
  "faq1_answer": "Small projects (e.g., one illustration) typically take about one week. Bigger projects usually take 2-4 weeks, depending on scope.",
  "faq2_question": "How many concepts do you provide?",
  "faq2_answer": "At the start, we align on the idea and I deliver two fully developed concept sketches. Each concept comes with its own story, meaning, and visual logic.",
  "faq3_question": "How many revision rounds are included?",
  "faq3_answer": "We lock the direction at the sketch/concept stage, then I refine it with your feedback while keeping the overall vision consistent. Small tweaks and clarifications are included (up to ~10), but the final artistic direction stays with me.",
  "faq4_question": "Do you deliver source files?",
  "faq4_answer": "Yes - I provide the files you need for your use case, including print-ready and high-resolution digital versions. Source files can be included when required and agreed in advance.",
  "faq5_question": "What does your process look like, step by step?",
  "faq5_answer": "We start with a call to explore the idea, goals, and best execution options, then sign a contract. If it's a physical space, I visit (or work from materials), build a plan, share the initial vision, and then deliver final files.",
  "faq6_question": "How does pricing and payment work (deposit, milestones)?",
  "faq6_answer": "I work with a 50% deposit for projects of any size. Payment terms are clearly stated in the contract we sign before starting.",
  "faq7_question": "Do you take rush projects?",
  "faq7_answer": "Yes, rush projects are possible depending on my schedule. Timeline and rush fee are discussed individually.",
  "faq8_question": "What do you need from me to get started?",
  "faq8_answer": "A quick conversation about what you have and what you want to achieve, plus access to your materials or space (if applicable). After that, I take the lead and handle the process.",
  "faq9_question": "Can we work together if my business is in another country?",
  "faq9_answer": "Absolutely - I work internationally and we can run everything via calls, messages, and mockups. For physical applications, I prepare clear production-ready files and guides tailored to your format.",
  "faq10_question": "Can we plan a long-term collaboration?",
  "faq10_answer": "Yes - long-term projects are welcome once we align on the scope, timeline, and working rhythm. I can lead the visual direction as an art director throughout the collaboration.",
